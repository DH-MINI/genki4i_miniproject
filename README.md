# genki4i_miniproject
CBU5201 mini-project

The mini-project has two separate components:


1.   **Basic component** [6 marks]: Using the genki4k dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input an image and predicts 1) whether the person in the image is similing or not 2) estimate the 3D head pose labels in the image.
2.   **Advanced component** [10 marks]: Formulate your own machine learning problem and build a machine learning solution using the genki4k dataset (https://inc.ucsd.edu/mplab/398/).
3.
